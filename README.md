# BendyBeam - The MATLAB Beam Simulator App

### About
This app is designed to intuitively demonstrate why beams are shaped the way they are and how their shape/material affects their performance. 

### To Do

- [ ] Enforce more restrictions on input edge cases (need to update where load is when length changes)
- [ ] Fix dynamic load arrow sizing
- [x] Implement supports 
- [x] Implement bending equations (still unsure if these are right, need some hand calcs)
- [x] Drop down for multiple materials
- [ ] Light for bending failures
- [ ] Buckling??????
