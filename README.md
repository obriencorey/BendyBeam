# BendyBeam - The MATLAB Beam Simulator App

### About
This app is designed to intuitively demonstrate why beams are shaped the way they are and how their shape/material affects their performance. 

### To Do

- [ ] Enforce more restrictions on input edge cases
- [ ] Fix dynamic load arrow sizing
- [ ] Implement supports 
- [ ] Implement bending equations
- [ ] Drop down for multiple materials
- [ ] Light for bending failures
- [ ] Buckling??????
